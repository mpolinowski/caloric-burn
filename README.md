# Getting started

This app is based on the [food-lookup-demo](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/) from fullstackreact.com.

Our sample app will be a simple food nutrition lookup table. The data driving the app is supplied by the USDA's [National Nutrient Database](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/usda-national-nutrient-database-for-standard-reference/).

First, git clone this repository and cd into that directory.

This is where the server lives (server.js). Inside of the db folder is a sqlite database containing the nutrition data.


# Server Setup

We now use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the Node Package Manager to install all dependencies for our app. Make sure that you install the latest version of node first. Then use your Terminal, or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com) under Windows, to run the following npm commands.

## Server Dependencies Installation

Use

```
npm install
```

to install all dependencies & dev-dependecies in a development environment (the default). Later you can use

```
npm install --production
```

or set the NODE_ENV environment variable to production to avoid installing dev-dependencies.

## Test the Server

Let's boot the server:

```
npm run server
```

This server provides a single API endpoint, /api/food. It expects a single parameter, q, the food we are searching for. You can test it with your browser or use the CURL command inside your console:

```
curl localhost:3001/api/food?q=mcflurry
```

Now that we understand how this endpoint works, let's build the front-end application. Kill the server with CTRL+C.


# Frontend Setup

Ensure that you have create-react-app installed globally:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

## create-react-app

At the top-level directory of the project we'll create our client app. We want the React app to be in a folder called client, so we'll just use that name in the create-react-app command:

```
create-react-app client
```

This creates a new directory with the following file structure:

```
ls client
README.md
node_modules/
package.json
public/
src/
```

Taking a look at client/package.json, we can see that we just installed react, react-dom, and react-scripts to the /client directory:

```
{
  "name": "client",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^15.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^15.6.1",
    "react-scripts": "1.0.12"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

Inside that directory, we can now run several commands:

>
* npm start
**  Starts the development server.
>
* npm run build
**  Bundles the app into static files for production.
>
* npm test
**  Starts the test runner.
>
* npm run eject
**  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
